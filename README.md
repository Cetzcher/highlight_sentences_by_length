# highlight_sentences_by_length

This is a tapermonkey / greasemonkey Plugin.
It adds a button in the top left corner which opens a panel.
The lower area is a textarea in which you can enter text.
The color of the sentence is determined by the sentence word count. 

This plugin is inspired by the plugin "Highlight the Music" for google docs.
